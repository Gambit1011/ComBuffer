## Info
Application is demonstrating some of the basic concepts to receive information on a communication port.
I used these techniques later in other projects to interface with a weighbridge, and 3G modems to send an SMS. Although serial (RS232) old technology is, is it still widely used in industry It is now being replace by Ethernet communication. But there is still a lot of technology that support it. Like UPS, Lab equipment and weighbridges just to name a few.
